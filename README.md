# Republic
Flask web app featuring a global static chat room, user-driven marketplace and democratic control of the site.

# About this project:

* Flask app. This is a technical showcase, not production software i.e. admin credentials are listed below.  
* There is a global chat room. It does not make use of web sockets so it is not dynamic.
* There is a marketplace that users can buy and sell on using fake currency.
* Any user can suggest and vote on changes to the app e.g. colour scheme changes. 
* Votes are upvotes/downvotes. Proposals with majority support are implemented automatically.
